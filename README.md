# matplotlib-challenge
For this challenge, data from a recent animal study by Pymaceutical was analyzed. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy of Capomulin for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with other treatment regimens. Mice with SCC tumors were given treatment with a range of drug regimens, and the tumor response was studied over 45 days. 

First, raw data from the study and the mouse metadata was merged and then cleaned to delete any duplicate entries. Then, a basic statistical analysis was performed on tumor size by drug regimen to determine the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. Bar charts were made to show the total number of mice that received each drug regimen, and pie charts were used to show the gender split of the mice. From here, 4 drug regimens were selected for detailed analysis. The final tumor volume for each mouse in the 4 regimens was determined, and then the data was checked for outliers and visualized with a box plot. A random mouse treated with Capomulin was selected, and a line plot was made to display tumor volume over the 45 day study period. Finally, a scatter plot was created which compared average tumor volume with mouse weight. A linear regression model was plotted on top of this scatter chart, and the correlation coefficient was determined to be 0.84. This entire analysis can be found in the "pymaceuticals_analysis.ipynb" file inside the "module_5_analysis" folder.
